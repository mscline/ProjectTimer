# ProjectTimer
Updated to Swift 2.3, but it did break some of the UI, such as viewing in landscape.
I wrote this as a demo app, to help me find a job.  But I ended up getting a job before I finished submitting it to the app store.
Wanted to steal a little bit of the code, so updated to Swift 2.3 - but didn't do any UI fixes.
